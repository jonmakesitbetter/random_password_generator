# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

This project was the creation of a password generator that allowed the user to select their
password criteria, including length (between 8 and 128 characters long) and what types of 
characters would be included. The character choices were to be capital letters, lower case
letters, numbers, and special characters. At the end of the selection, a randomly generated 
password that adheres to the user's criteria would be displayed. Below, the acceptance 
criteria can be found.

## Acceptance Criteria
